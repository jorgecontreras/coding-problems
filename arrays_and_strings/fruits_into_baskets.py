# FRUITS INTO BASKETS
#
# Problem Statement:
#
# Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, 
# and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
# The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
# You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. 
# You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
#
# Intuition:
# In other words, we are looking for the longest subarray with at most two distinct elements
#
# This problem can be solved using the sliding window pattern.
#
# Algorithm:
# Open the window
# Start storing the "fruits" into a dictionary.
# Keep moving forward until dictionary length goes over 2, which means we have reached more that 2 type of fruits.
# start closing the window, decreasing and eventually removing one element of the dictionary.
# Store the size of the subarray we reached at that point
# Continue with remaining elements
#
# Time complexity: O(N), we need to traverse all elements once.
# Space complexity: O(1), there will be at most 3 types of fruits stored at a time.
