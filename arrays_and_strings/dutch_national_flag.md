# Dutch national flag problem 

Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal. You're not allowed to use any sorting function that Python provides.

Note: O(n) does not necessarily mean single-traversal. For e.g. if you traverse the array twice, that would still be an O(n) solution but it will not count as single traversal.

# Time complexity

The problem is solved in **O(n)** and in one single pass

# Space complexity

Space is constant **O(1)** because all the swapping happens in place, without additional storage
